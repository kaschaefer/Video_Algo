Notes From the Problem Solver:

By the time I finished coding a solution that I was okay with submitting, I realized that a lookup table would have been immensely helpful in this scenario. There are definitely better solutions out there, performance wise, but this was the one I felt like I could wrap my mind around and implement in (close to) the time given.
